This phylogeny shows evolution of SARS-like betacoronaviruses including samples from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei and in China. SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses from the COVID-19 epidemic are colored in red, SARS-CoV-1 coronaviruses from the 2002-03 SARS outbreak are colored in yellow, while related SARS-like coronaviruses are colored in blue.
